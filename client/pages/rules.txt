- access control happens only at the page level (templates can be loaded at-will)
- the rest of the page is access-controlled via API calls (i.e. a blank template can be loaded without auth but the data that goes on the page cannot be loaded without auth)
- pages define everything, e.g. header, nav, body, footer
- pages make healthy use of directives (which subsequently load from templates directory)
